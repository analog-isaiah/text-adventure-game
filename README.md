# "Dreams": A Text-Based Adventure Game in Python 3

This is my text-based Adventure Game, "Dreams," that I developed during my undergraduate studies.

- Players navigate an eight-bedroom house, searching for the six items needed to defeat the final boss.
- The game uses dictionaries, loops, and functions to assess player location, let players pick up items, let players use items, and determine whether players win or lose the game.
